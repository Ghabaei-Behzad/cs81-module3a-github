# Learning REFLECTION.MD

# 1. What did you learn about using Git and Github?
 We're learning how to use the command line to track versions of code and sync my work from my local machine with a remote repository on Github.
# 2. What was most onfusing or frustrating?
Setting up the connection and knowing how to stage and commit and the initial download and setup. Remembering to add before commiting.
# 3.  Why do you think developers use Git?
Allowing multiple people to work on the same project without overwritting code and having a history of changes to go by in case something breaks.
# 4.  How might this help with larger projects in the future?
Collaboration is made easier (just like using Slack) and every feature can be developed and tested in a controlled way before any code is merged into the main project.
